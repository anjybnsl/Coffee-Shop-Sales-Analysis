# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis

I just finished crunching the numbers for Maven Roasters, a cool NYC coffee shop chain with three popular locations! My goal? To find hidden gems in their data that could help them grow even bigger and better.

Through this project, I employed various excel functions and techniques to extract insights, identify trends, and optimize strategies for enhancing sales performance. From sales trends to customer behavior analysis, this project showcases my proficiency in Excel for data analytics and my dedication to driving actionable insights.
